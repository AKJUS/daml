Support and feedback
====================

Have questions or feedback? You're in the right place.

Questions: Stack Overflow
	For “how do I?”, “why does something work this way” or “I’ve got a programming problem I’m trying to solve” questions, the `daml tag on Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/daml>`_ is the best place to ask. 

	If you're not sure what makes a good question, take a look at `this checklist <https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2012/11/24/stack-overflow-question-checklist/>`_. 
Help and feedback: Slack, or Support widget
	If you want to give feedback, or have questions that aren't right for Stack Overflow, you can: 

	- Join the DAML community on `Slack <https://damldriven.slack.com/sso/saml/start>`_.
	- Ask us for help using the `Support <javascript:open_feedback()>`_ link on any documentation page.
Feedback: Email
	If you'd rather use email, you can contact us at `sdk-feedback@digitalasset.com <mailto:sdk-feedback@digitalasset.com>`_.
