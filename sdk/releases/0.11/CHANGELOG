    - Sandbox: Transaction Service now requires that the begin field is less than the end field.
    - Sandbox: Identifier values now expose `module_name` and `entity_name` fields, both parts of the original `name` field. Users of the API are advised to start sending and consuming the new fields instead of `name` as that will be deprecated in the future. The server still accepts the 'name' field in inbound messages, and populates all fields in outbound messages to ensure backward compatibility.
    - Sandbox: All RPC features are enabled by default. The --no-parity flag remains in place, but does not currently affect functionality.
