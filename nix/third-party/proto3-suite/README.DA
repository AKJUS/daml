This is the vendored library from github.com/awakesecurity/proto3-suite,
commit revision 94a87913eac90b38dec110b753f75476d6d33193.

For the Bazel based builds of this library some of the test cases needed
to be disabled as they invoked GHC from within the test, which in Bazel will not
have the proto3-suite/proto3-wire as a registered package.
